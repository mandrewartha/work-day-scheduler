# work-day-scheduler

This work day scheduler was created by combining HTML,CSS,JavaScript, and Third-Party API's. A basic outline was created in HTML using elements from Bootstrap. The items were styled with CSS using id's and classes. The text that is typed into each textbox is saved using local storage. The blocks are colored according to what time it is and if they are in the past, present, or future. This was done using two arrays and a for loop that added CSS classes.
